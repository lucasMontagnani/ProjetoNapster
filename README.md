# ProjetoNapster
P2P system that allows the transfer of gigantic video files (more than 1 GB) between peers, intermediated by a centralized server, using TCP and UDP as transport layer protocol. 
The system will work in a similar way (but very reduced) to the Napster system

### üíª Description
<p>The system will consist of 1 server (with known IP and port) and many peers. the peer
acts both as a provider of information (in this case files) and as a receiver from them.
Initially, the server will be available to receive requests from peers. When one
PeerX enters the system, it must communicate its information to the server. The server will receive
information and store it for future reference. When a PeerY wants to download
a video, you must send a request with the file name to the server. The server
will look up the name and respond to PeerY with a list of peers that contain it. O
PeerY will receive the list from the server and choose one of the peers from the list (let's assume that the
chosen is PeerZ). Next, PeerY will request the file for PeerZ, who can
accept the request by sending the file, or reject the request. Finally, when PeerY
download the file into a folder, the person can go to the folder and view it using a
external playback software such as VLC.</p>
